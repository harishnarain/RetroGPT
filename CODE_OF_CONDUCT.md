# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. With that said let's keep this really simple and respect everyone's freedom of expression. Everyone is free to say or do what they want. Just be excellent to each other, and act like mature men and women.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Being excellent to each other
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness
- Being respectful of differing opinions
- Giving and gracefully accepting feedback

Examples of unacceptable behavior:
- Being woke and forcing one's woke views on each other
- Engaging in cancel culture
- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments
- Personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at harishnarain@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
